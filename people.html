        <p>BALTIMORE -- Delores Buchanan, 72, stays inside when it’s cold. Neuropathy causes her feet to tense up and sting, and cold worsens the pain by reducing blood flow to the hands and feet. It is one of many health conditions exacerbated by extreme temperatures.</p>

        <p>“I try to avoid really extreme cold conditions because it’s really not good for me,” she said. “I try to get somewhere warm as soon as possible.”</p>

        <p>To soothe the pain in her feet and relax her muscles, she takes hot baths with Epsom salts.</p>

        <p>“There’s no better feeling than getting in a hot tub of water and relaxing,” she said. “It just makes my body feel so good.”</p>

        <p>Buchanan used to take those baths every night, but now she’s passing on them in an effort to save money. Two summers ago, her water heater burst. The repairs were an unexpected expense, and the flooding caused her water bill to skyrocket. Her latest water bill says she still owes $1,186.36. </p>

        <p>She missed a month’s payment to BGE, the Maryland utility company, because she already had been behind on her bills, she received a turnoff notice. “First time I got a turnoff notice. I never got a turnoff notice in my life. </p>

        <p>“I said, ‘Oh, my Lord.’ Pray pray pray pray.”</p>

        <p>She said she took out a $1,500 high-interest loan from a “predatory” lender, which she expects to pay off by the end of this year.</p>

        <p>“I had to take what I could get real fast,” she said.</p>

        <p>She gets by on about $760 a month from Social Security.</p>

        <p>Buchanan owns a 99-year-old, two-story rowhouse in the Oliver neighborhood, on the city’s east side. </p>

        <p>She keeps the house warm.  </p>

        <p class="chapter-head">INSERT SENSOR DATA HERE</p>

        <p>The water heater is fixed, but in an effort to climb out of debt, she’s trying to limit how much water she uses. That means she only takes her hot bath once or twice a week, usually as a weekend treat, or to loosen up the night before church.</p>


                <br>

                  <div class="embed-container">
                      <span class="quote-mark">“</span>
                      <p class="quote">I can’t afford to keep compiling that water bill. It just scares me to death.</p>

        <p>The city’s Department of Public Works estimated the average monthly water bill for a three-person house at $92. That number will increase by 30% over the next three years and double in 10. Residents already pay about twice what they did nine years ago.</p>

        <p>Buchanan’s low income means she’s careful about how much hot water she uses. Because she limits the hot water, she experiences more pain. And because she’s in more pain, she says, she’s unable to work.</p>

        <p>She’s spent most of her life in this rowhouse neighborhood near the Johns Hopkins medical campus. According to data compiled by the city’s Department of Planning, Oliver’s population decreased by 24% between 2000 and 2010. More than 70% of households in Oliver have incomes below $50,000. </p>

        <p>Buchanan was born in Washington and spent much of her childhood in a middle-class suburb of Columbia, South Carolina. She said that her mother was a “gypsy,” bouncing around the East Coast and Midwest. Her father was never in her life, and she was mostly raised by an aunt and uncle.</p>

        <p>She moved to Baltimore as a teenager found it a “breathtakingly beautiful city.” </p>

        <p>After graduating from Dunbar High School, she earned an associate’s degree from the now defunct Bay College of Maryland, then studied sociology and psychology at Antioch University in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where her mother worked. She says she earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees and returned to Baltimore to work at a health center.</p>

        <p>She was briefly married, but she and her husband separated in their 20s, and she doesn’t have children.</p>

        <p>She said she worked part time for 20 years as a personal care provider, a position she said was like being a nursing assistant. She visited homes and assisted people with housekeeping and other daily activities and took them to doctor’s appointments.</p>

        <p>Buchanan was driving when she experienced the symptoms of neuropathy for the first time. One day, she said, her foot clenched like a fist. She pulled over and had to pry open her toes with her hands.</p>

        <p>She had always been athletic -- she ran track at Dunbar -- so she was confused by the diagnosis.</p>

      <p>  She said she knows some people with diabetes experience neuropathy, but she doesn’t know what caused her condition. “It’s like trying to walk with bricks on your feet,” she said. “It’s not the normal type of movement in the feet.”</p>

        <p>On bad days, she doesn’t move easily around the house.</p>

        <p>Built in 1920, the house has never been renovated, and she points out repairs that were begun but never completed. The water heater, in the basement below the kitchen, severely damaged the kitchen’s wall panelling. It started growing mold and had to be stripped, exposing the boards beneath. It has not been replaced.</p>

        <p>"Every time I come in this kitchen it takes my spirit away,” she said.</p>

        <p>Her roof needs to be repaired, and she’s hoping a community organization can help her.  A leak in her bathroom is causing the wallpaper to peel.</p>

        <p>To pay her bills, Buchanan took temporary jobs, including a demanding one where she worked 12-hour days on her feet three or four times a week. She took the job despite the signs her body gave her.</p>

              <p class="quote">My inner spirit said, ‘Don’t do it, don’t do it,’ but I was trying to keep this house going.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>While she worked that temp job, she said she wasn’t taking care of herself. She wasn’t eating breakfast and was losing weight.</p>

        <p>The work “just tore me down,” she said. “For someone like me it was extremely difficult.”</p>

        <p>After working there for a year, she had a stroke in early 2018. She hasn’t worked since, but said she would like an easy job.</p>

        <p>Buchanan says her only choice is to sell the house. According to the state Department of Assessments and Taxation, it’s worth $44,000. She said she’s gotten offers as low as $20,000. She wants to move out as soon as possible, but she won’t settle for an offer that low.</p>

        <p>“I don’t have the income to stay in my house,” she said. “My back is against the wall and I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>As global warming continues to increase the atmosphere’s temperature, cold snaps persist in cities like Baltimore and won’t vanish anytime soon.</p>
<p>Extremely cold weather will remain a factor in the Northeast because of disruptions in the polar vortex, a phenomenon that pushes cold arctic air into the United States. Because cold snaps will occur in the future, Baltimore can’t ignore the effects of freezing temperatures on its residents.</p>

<br>

<p>There are common misconceptions about the relationship between the warming of the atmosphere and the frequency of cold snaps. A warmer climate doesn’t cause extreme cold weather to become extinct, said Judah Cohen, the Director of Seasonal Forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. </p>

<p>“There is this generalized warming of the planet that would decrease extreme winter weather,” Cohen said. “But also on the other hand, there are more frequent disruptions of the polar vortex which would increase [it], so it's kind of a tug-of-war between the two.”</p>

<p>Days that dipped below 20 degrees and 10 degrees, however, do appear to be occurring at a less frequent rate. </p>

<p>Freezing days haven’t gone away because of the climate change effects on the polar vortex. The polar vortex consists of air masses located above the North and South Pole that contain trapped cold air. </p>
<p>Due to the warming of the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere that lies above the one we live in — the polar vortex weakens and can break into multiple sections. This allows the cold air that was once contained in the vortex to escape the poles and move extreme cold temperatures to lower latitudes, such as the continental United States. </p>
