        <p>Hill wasn’t surprised. A member of the American Lung Association’s national board of directors, he knows that cold weather is broadly hazardous to public health in chillier parts of the country, including Maryland.
</p>
        <p>The rippling effects of rising temperatures dominate most discussions of the impact of climate change on public health. But while temperatures are also expected to increase in the winter, scientists warn of extreme weather events -- severe cold snaps -- that would pose a threat. </p>

        <p>There’s extensive evidence that sustained exposure to extreme cold can cause harm by lowering body temperature, weakening the immune system and aggravating asthma, cardiovascular and lung disease, arthritis, diabetes and mental illness, among other problems.</p>

        <p>Every winter health officials warn of outdoor dangers for the homeless who can freeze to death from hypothermia and snow shovelers who suffer heart attacks. Yet many more people are at risk indoors if their power has been shut off or they can’t afford to raise the thermostat. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935102000099?via%3Dihub">Research</a> shows that for those with chronic disease a cold interior may be a dangerous environment.</p>

        <!-- end full screen image-->


      <p>In Baltimore, people most at risk live in low-income, mainly black neighborhoods where certain chronic conditions affected by cold are most prevalent, a Capital News Service analysis LINK of Maryland hospital records and U.S. Census data shows.</p>

      <p>Many residents can’t afford to pay heating bills, according to Baltimore Gas and Electric Company and state data, while others lack money to add insulation, repair or replace furnaces, or move out of decrepit rental housing where wind whistles through cracks around doors and windows.</p>
      <p>Research into climate change is a rapidly evolving field with some studies that challenge previous assumptions, including that heat is a bigger killer than cold. In fact, the opposite is true, according to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr076.pdf">report</a> from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control in 2014. Of nearly 11,000 weather-related deaths between 2006 and 2010, 63% were attributable to “excessive natural cold,” 31% to heat and the remainder to floods, lightning and storms.</p>

      <p>The number of weather-related deaths may actually be larger, the CDC report said. It’s sometimes difficult to pinpoint a cause or a contributing factor. Someone with a history of chronic disease may be listed on a death certificate as having died of that, when in fact exposure to the cold made his condition fatally worse. Other times, death occurs weeks or months after exposure to cold triggered a decline in health. </p>

      <p>One more factor, the report says, is whether the environment in which a person dies is taken into account: “If an elderly person dies at home and the home was under-heated, this contributing cause may not be noted.”</p>
      <p>Such research may influence policy makers to take a closer look not only at the direct causes of cold-related deaths and health problems -- notably hypothermia, which leads to a dangerous drop in body temperature -- but other factors such as home environment. </p>

<p>Given the role that chronic disease plays, groups with higher rates of it are more likely to die. Studies show that mortality rates for heat- and cold-related exposure are higher among the elderly, African Americans and men -- more so in low-income areas. </p>

<p>In Maryland, since <a href="https://preparedness.health.maryland.gov/Documents/Weekly%20Cold%20Report%20Apr.%203,%202019.pdf">the winter</a> of 2013-2014, there have been 208 cold-related deaths, including 51 this winter, the vast majority of whom were not homeless, according to official statistics. Capital News Service reviewed six winters’ weekly reports published by the Maryland Office of Preparedness and Response <a href="https://preparedness.health.maryland.gov/Pages/Reports_ColdArchive.aspx">during this period </a>and found that 63 of the 208, or 30% died in Baltimore, which is home to only about 10% of the state’s population. Men accounted for about three quarters of the deaths.</p>

<p>A year after the CDC’s report, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/6/064016/meta"> another</a> probed deeply into winter mortality data in the U.S. and France and debunked temperature as a primary cause. “The evidence suggests that cold plays a limited direct role,” the 2015 report said, identifying more important “seasonal factors” such as flu -- an “important direct risk factor for winter mortality” partly because it’s especially dangerous for those with cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Even if cold isn’t a direct cause of many deaths, it exacerbates health problems that over the long run may contribute to premature death and diminished quality of life. In Baltimore, the neighborhood-level prevalence of some chronic health conditions rises and falls in tandem with familiar markers: variations in race, income, poverty and housing conditions. </p>

<p>A Capital News Service analysis of state hospital and emergency room records and U.S. Census data found that rates of respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease and arthritis are generally higher in city ZIP codes that have a higher percentage of African-American residents. </p>

<p>The rates of hypothermia, asthma and COPD are all generally higher in city ZIP codes that have higher poverty rates.</p>


<p class="chapter-head">MAIN HEALTH INTERACTIVE GOES HERE THAT JAKE IS FINISHING MONDAY</p>

<p>Consider asthma, the health condition that fluctuated most closely in line with markers of race and poverty in the analysis.</p>

<p>In a swath of West Baltimore that borders Leakin Park (ZIP code 21216), 19 out of 20 residents are black, the highest concentration in the city. Between 2013 and 2018, 16% of inpatient hospital visits (and 15%  of emergency room visits)  by people from that ZIP code featured an asthma diagnosis, CNS found.  </p>

<p>In the most white area, ZIP code 21211, which includes the Hampden and Woodberry neighborhoods, the asthma rate was about half as large.  About 9% of inpatient hospital visits (and 7% of emergency room visits) by people from that ZIP code featured an asthma diagnosis. </p>

<p class="chapter-head">SCREENCAP OF INTERACTIVE SHOWING ASTHMA AND RACE GOES HERE</p>

<p>In ZIP code 21223, centered on Franklin Square and Carrollton Ridge, nearly two of every five people live below the poverty line, the highest rate in the city. The asthma diagnosis rate there was 17% for inpatient hospital visits and 15% for emergency room visits.  That was more than double the rate for the city ZIP code with the lowest concentration of poor people, 21228, which spills over the the city line into Catonsville.  There, the asthma rate for inpatient visits was 8%, and 7% for emergency room visits. </p>

<p class="chapter-head">SCREENCAP OF INTERACTIVE SHOWING ASTHMA AND POVERTY GOES HERE</p>

<p>The physiological reasons why cold undermines health are generally agreed on, if not perfectly understood. Older people and others with health problems may be less able to control their body temperatures. Veins and arteries constrict at lower temperatures, stressing the cardiovascular system. Brain function may be affected.</p>

<p>It’s clear there’s a strong connection between cold air and lung disease, Hill says. “Patients who have asthma or who have COPD on really cold days tend to have more wheezing and more shortness of breath.”</p>

<p>A CNS analysis of Baltimore city emergency response data measures illustrates this relationship. Between 2014 and 2018, on days when the temperature fell below 40 degrees, 9% of all EMS calls were for respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD, compared to 6% when the temperature was 40 or above.</p>

<p>When it comes to arthritis, many who suffer from it see a connection to cold, yet studies conflict.</p>

<p>For most of her life, Katie Roberts, 42, an Arthritis Foundation advocacy chairwoman in Maryland, has lived with psoriatic arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disease that may initially cause red, flaky patches. She says she can feel when a winter weather storm is coming with 99% accuracy. Some research supports that, including a 2007 <a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(06)01026-6/pdf">study</a> suggesting that changes in barometric pressure as well as temperature “influence severity of knee pain.” </p>

<p>Outdoor temperatures also may affect people indirectly.</p>

  <div class="embed-container">
      <span class="quote-mark">“</span>
      <p class="quote">If the weather's bad, people stay inside, and for arthritis, we know that, even when you hurt -- even if it hurts to move -- the movement is actually medicine. If you're not getting out and getting that exercise, the bad weather could indirectly be causing you to experience some pain.</p>
      <span class="quote-mark2">”</span>
      <p class="quote-attribution"> ― Guy Eakin, senior vice president of scientific strategy at the Arthritis Foundation</p>

    <p>On cold days, people with diabetes are also less likely to exercise, which research <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/exercise-is-good-for-diabetes">shows</a> can help control weight and regulate blood sugar. On the other hand, insulin, glucose monitors and test strips will not work properly when exposed to cold temperatures and should be protected, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia <a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/hot-tips-managing-diabetes-cold-weather">advises</a>.</p>

    <p>In 2018, Baltimore had 42 days when the temperature hit or dipped below freezing. Weather that cold not only discourages exercise but also keeps people from getting essential treatment.</p>

    <p>“If you happen to be somebody that needs dialysis treatment three times a week and there's the extreme cold, where the roads are too icy, then you cannot go and get your dialysis treatment,” which can be life-threatening, said Amir Sapkota, associate professor at the Maryland Institute of Applied Environmental Health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health.</p>

    <p>Carbon monoxide exposures, a different kind of indoor hazard, peak in the winter, according to a federal research <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848267/">report</a>, when people are more likely to use generators, stoves and home heating systems that may not be properly maintained.</p>

    <p>When inhaled, carbon monoxide deprives the brain and heart of oxygen, causing headaches, fatigue and nausea. Severe cases of carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to long-term health problems and even death.</p>

    <p>Fire is another winter home hazard. Fifteen percent of home fires involve heating equipment, almost all space heaters, according to the National Fire Prevention Association.</p>

    <p>The list of diseases associated with cold exposure includes a category that initially might seem puzzling: mental illness. But prolonged cold spells can “create chronic stress situations” affecting psychological well being, according to a 2010 <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/materials/a_human_health_perspective_on_climate_change_full_report_508.pdf">report</a> from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the publication Environmental Health Perspectives.</p>

    <p>People with steady incomes are better able than those of more modest means to fend off the effects of the cold, and mitigate them with they occur. But common sense is free.</p>

    <p>When it’s frigid outdoors, Delores Buchanan, 72, stays inside her 99-year-old, two-story rowhouse in Baltimore’s Oliver neighborhood. A hot bath, she says, goes a long way toward easing the neuropathy that causes her feet to tense up and sting. Cold worsens the pain by reducing blood flow to the hands and feet. It can also lead to further nerve damage.</p>

    <p>“I try to avoid really extreme cold conditions because it’s really not good for me,” said Buchanan, who also had a stroke in 2018. “I try to get somewhere warm as soon as possible.”</p>
