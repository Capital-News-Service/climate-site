<p>And, perhaps paradoxically, climate change could mean an increase in extremely cold weather in the Northeast during the winter.  That’s because of how climate change will affect the “polar vortex,” a phenomenon that pushes cold arctic air into the United States. </p>

<p>A warmer climate doesn’t cause extreme cold weather to become extinct, said Judah Cohen, the Director of Seasonal Forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research. </p>

<p>“There is this generalized warming of the planet that would decrease extreme winter weather,” Cohen said. “But also on the other hand, there are more frequent disruptions of the polar vortex which would increase [it], so it's kind of a tug-of-war between the two.” </p>

<p class="caption">Temperatures recorded in Baltimore Harbor dipped to 9 degrees on Jan. 31, 2019. It marked the lowest temperature collected by that sensor in four years. The last time temperatures recorded by the BWI sensor dipped below zero came in 1996, but dangerous, frigid temperatures persist annually throughout the city amid climate change. </p>

      <p>In the near term, winter cold snaps continue to be a problem for Baltimore residents, particularly those with chronic medical conditions affected by cold. When the temperature in the Inner Harbor fell to 9 degrees on Jan. 31, it marked the third year with a single digit day in the last six years in the city.  </p>

        <p>Even as global temperatures have risen over the last century, the number of sub-freezing days in Baltimore have stayed relatively constant.  </p>

  <p>One factor contributing to the continued persistence of cold days: climate change’s effect on the polar vortex. </p>
  <p>The polar vortex is a mass of air located above the North and South poles that contains trapped cold air.  Under normal circumstances, it remains at the top and bottom of the world.  </p>

      <div class="embed-container">
        <!-- Full screen image -->

        <!-- end full screen image-->
      </div>

      <p>When the stratosphere — the layer of the atmosphere that lies above the one we live in — warms, the polar vortex weakens and can break into multiple sections. This allows the cold air to escape the poles and bring extreme cold temperatures to other parts of the world, such as the continental United States. This happened in January, and brought frigid temperatures to the Midwest and, to a lesser extent, the Northeast.</p>

          <div class="embed-container">

                  <p class="caption">In January 2019, the polar vortex dropped deep into the continental United States, causing record-breaking temperatures in the Midwest and frigid weather across the Northeast. NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument captured the temperature fluctuation in vivid detail. </p>

              </figure>
          </div>


<p>The impact from these disruptions could last anywhere from four-to-eight weeks, according to Cohen, a wide range that makes it difficult to predict how long future cold snaps will be.</p>

<p>“You may get a cold snap like we had with that polar vortex event in late January in the upper Midwest, where they had that historic cold then it moderating quickly, so that's more typical,” Cohen said. “We think of it as more episodic, but there are cases where it's been continuous when the pattern gets locked and it doesn't change."</p>

<p>In Baltimore, there isn’t an indication that extended cold snaps are getting more common. The occurrence of three-day-long cold snaps during which the temperature fell below freezing on all of those days are just as sporadic as previous years. </p>


  <div class="embed-container">
     <h1 class="highcharts-title">Extended cold snaps stay constant in Baltimore</h1>
      <p class="caption">In Baltimore, the number of cold snaps that last at least three days or at least five days hasn't changed significantly over the years. In the last eight decades, three-day cold snaps peaked in the 1990s while five-day cold snaps peaked in the 1960s.</p>

<p>The most extreme cold snaps -- extended periods with temperatures far below normal average temperatures for the location and time of year -- in the Northeastern United States are the result of polar vortex disruptions driven by climate change, according to Cohen.</p>

<p>This winter saw a variety of weird weather across the U.S.  Snowfall hit Maui, Hawaii at its lowest elevation ever. Meanwhile, Seattle recorded record-breaking temperatures and Las Vegas had snowfall for the first time in over a decade.  It’s hard to say whether those events were also driven by climate change, or happened at random.</p>

      <p class="quote">How do you determine if that's an indication of a changing climate and not just the weather event?” That's the trick and that's a question among climate communities.</p>
      <span class="quote-mark2">”</span>
      <p class="quote-attribution"> ― Tim Canty, an oceanic and atmospheric professor at the University of Maryland.</p>
  </div>
<br>
<br>

<p>What experts do know is that sporadic winter weather will continue, including in the city of Baltimore. Cold snaps have regularly occurred in the Northeastern U.S. over the last 30 years.  The pattern is not expected to change, according to Cohen.</p>

<p>Extreme cold weather events have always happened, are still happening and show no signs of completely disappearing, despite a decrease in extremely cold days.</p>

<p>“And the difficulties with this and trying to get people to care about this is … we had this massive cold snap this year,” Canty said. “But what about if next year it's 70 degrees all winter long and everyone's happy about that?”</p>
